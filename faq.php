                    <p><strong>Judicial review,</strong> power of the courts of a country to examine the actions of the legislative, executive, and administrative arms of the government and to determine whether such actions are consistent with the constitution. Actions judged inconsistent are declared unconstitutional and, therefore, null and void. The institution of judicial review in this sense depends upon the existence of a written constitution.

                    <p>Legal Practice of Law in Connecticut:
                  The Superior Court regulates the practice of law in Connecticut. There are three ways to practice law legally in Connecticut. (They are more fully described in the Connecticut Practice Book Sections 8 and following.)<br>
     <strong>1. Bar Admission;</strong><br>
     <strong>2. Connecticut recognition of attorney licensed to practice law in another state (Pro Hac Vice);</strong> and,<br>
     <strong>3. Law student certification.</strong></p>

                    <p>The procedure for disciplining lawyers is also in the Practice Book, beginning with Section 2-29. In addition, the Statewide Grievance Committee has adopted its own rules of procedure to supplement those found in the practice book.
               The Statewide Bar Counsel reviews your complaint and either sends it to be investigated by a grievance panel or sends it to the Statewide Grievance Committee with a recommendation that it be dismissed for one of the reasons stated below.<br>

        <strong>Some reasons for dismissing complaints:</strong><br>

     only involves a fee dispute which is not clearly excessive or improper;
     no claim of misconduct;<br>
              does not contain specific enough information on which to base an investigation;<br>
              duplicates a complaint already considered and dismissed; or,
              involves personal behavior outside the practice of law.
              Every Judicial District has a grievance panel made up of one lay person and two attorneys who do not have offices in the Judicial District. The panel decides whether there is "probable cause" to believe that the lawyer is guilty of misconduct. The grievance panel may hold a hearing on your complaint as part of their investigation. A copy of the grievance panel's probable cause decision will be sent to you within 120 days of the referral to the panel.<br>

              All determinations of a grievance panel finding that there exists probable cause of misconduct are referred to the Statewide Grievance Committee for further action. The committee conducts a hearing open to the public on probable cause referrals. If the complaint is filed on or after January 1, 2004, a disciplinary counsel will present the case to the Committee at its hearing when probable cause of misconduct is found. If a grievance panel determines that there is no probable cause of misconduct, it will dismiss the complaint. Such a dismissal is a final decision, subject to no further review, unless there is an allegation in the complaint that the attorney committed a crime, in which case a finding of no probable cause will be reviewed by the Statewide Grievance Committee. The Statewide Grievance Committee is a board of 21 members. At least seven of them are not lawyers. The committee makes the final decision on the grievance or complaint.

                    <p>The Client Security Fund Committee may reimburse losses resulting from the dishonest conduct of a Connecticut attorney who has died, been adjudged incapable, not competent or mentally ill, been disbarred or suspended from the practice of law, been placed on inactive status by a Connecticut court, resigned from the Connecticut bar, or against whom a judgment has been obtained with respect to the dishonest conduct. "Dishonest conduct" means wrongful acts committed by an attorney, in an attorney-client relationship, in the nature of theft or embezzlement of money or the wrongful taking of money, property or other things of value. It does not include wrongful acts committed in connection with the provision of investment services. Furthermore, a loss ordinarily will not be covered by the fund if the claim is presented more than four years after the loss was discovered or should have been discovered or if the loss was suffered by a close relative, business associate or partner of the attorney. In some cases, the Client Security Fund Committee may require you to pursue other remedies that you may have against the attorney who caused your loss before considering your claim, such as filing a civil lawsuit against the attorney or the attorney's estate.</p>

                    <p><strong>1.Yes,</strong> you may contact a Family Relations Counselor who will provide you with information, assistance and a referral to a Family Violence Victim Advocate. In the event of a pending family violence arrest, information you provide to a Family Relations Counselor may be shared with the court.<br>
                      <strong>2.</strong>Family Violence Victim Advocates are available in each geographical area court location. Family Violence Victim Advocates are staff members of the local domestic violence program. They provide support and services for victims of family violence. Conversations with a Family Violence Victim Advocate are confidential. This means a Victim Advocate will not tell anyone else what you have told them unless you give permission to do so or the law requires it.<br>
                     <strong>2.</strong>There is also a Domestic Violence hotline available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, by dialing 1-888-774-2900.<br>
                     <strong>2.</strong>If there has been an arrest and it has been referred to Family Services for assessment, a Family Relations Counselor will schedule an appointment to speak to you.</p>
